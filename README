This is a cryptogram solver that I wrote to RSVP for the NYC Hack-and-Tell in September 2011.
It learns a simple language model from some text that you give it and then uses simulated annealing
to find the most likely solution to the cryptogram.  It will also attempt to figure out spacing
as well, however it doesn't really work very well right now.  See the help output for more
information on how to run it.

The program requires some source text to build its language model.  I used 'Alice in Wonderland' 
from Project Gutenburg, but any relatively long English text should work well.
You can download 'Alice in Wonderland' for free here: http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/11

By default the program will attempt to solve the original cryptogram I was trying to solve, but
it will accept others as well.  The solution to the cryptogram is an excerpt from the preamble
to the GPL:
